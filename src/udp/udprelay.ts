  /**
   * A UDP-based "relay" server intended for use as part of a SOCKS5 proxy:
   *   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt
   *
   * Briefly, here's how to use this:
   *  - create an instance of this class
   *  - call bind (you probably want to specify port zero to have the system
   *    pick a free port)
   *  - call getInfo, to discover on which port the relay is listening
   *  - (the caller can now return the address and port back to the SOCKS
   *    client)
   *  - call setDataReceivedHandler
   *  - this class will invoke the setDataReceivedHandler each time a datagram
   *    is received on the socket; the full message is sent, including SOCKS
   *    UDP headers
   *  - (the caller can relay the message across the datachannel)
   *  - call sendRemoteReply for each datagram received from remote hosts; this
   *    will be sent to the client, and should include the same SOCKS UDP
   *    header received in the original request
   *  - call destroy to clean up, typically when the TCP connection on which
   *    the UDP_ASSOCIATE was negotiated is terminated
   *
   * One relay should be created in response to each UDP_ASSOCIATE command.
   *
   * Other notes:
   *  - while the RFC states that the relay MUST drop any message originating
   *    from an IP other than that which requested the association, this
   *    implementation makes no effort to do so (this isn't urgent because we
   *    typically only listen locally)
   *  - similarly, we make no effort to respect the DST.PORT and DST.ADDR fields
   *    specified by the client during the handshake: having run various proxy
   *    clients it seems that these are rarely specified anyway (which is fine
   *    according to section 6 of the RFC)
   *    and, in any case, we are typically only listening locally
   *  - we make no attempt to implement fragmentation (see section 7 of the
   *    RFC)
   *
   * TODO: this is so similar to udprelay.ts that they can almost certainly
   *       be merged into one
